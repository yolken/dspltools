Description: "minixsv is a lightweight XML schema validator written in 'pure'
Python. Currently a subset of the XML schema standard is supported.
minixsv is based on genxmlif, a generic XML interface class,
which currently supports minidom, elementtree or 4DOM/pyXML as XML parser.
Other parsers can be adapted by implementing an appropriate derived interface
class."
