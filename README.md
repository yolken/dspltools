DSPL Tools
==========

Tools for creating and checking [DSPL](https://developers.google.com/public-data/) datasets.

The library was written while I was an employee at Google; the version here was forked from the
[original Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/dspl/).

See the [Google Developers site](https://developers.google.com/public-data/) for complete documentation and usage examples.
